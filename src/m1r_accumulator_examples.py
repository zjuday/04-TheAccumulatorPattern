"""
This module demonstrates the ACCUMULATOR pattern in three classic forms:
   SUMMING:       total = total + number
   COUNTING:      count = count + 1
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

Authors: David Mutchler, Vibha Alangar, Matt Boutell, Dave Fisher, Mark Hays,
         Aaron Wilkin, their colleagues, and Zachary Juday.

#
# DONE: 2.
#   RUN this program, then READ its code.
#     Then answer the following, GETTING HELP AS NEED!  (Ask questions!!!)
#     Write your answers in any reasonable way (your choice).
#
#     For the first several questions, some students find the following
#     picture helpful.  (Your instructor may explain it in whole-group.)
#
#         0  1  2  3  4  ...  r-1  r  r+1  r+2  r+3  ...  s
#         |..... r numbers .....|
#         |................ s+1 numbers ..................|
# Hence:                          |... (s+1)-r numbers ...|
#
#     a. If you want a loop that runs   r   times,
#          which of the following three choices would you use?
#
#            for k in range(r - 1):
#            for k in range(r): x
#            for k in range(r + 1):
#
#     b. If you want a loop that runs from 0 to s, inclusive,
#          what expression would you use in the _____ below?
#
#            for k in range(s+1):
#
#     c. If you want a loop that runs from r to s, inclusive, assuming s >= r,
#          what expression would you use in the _____ below?
#
#            for k in range(s+1-r):
#
#     d. If you want a loop that runs from (r + 4) to (s - 10),
#          including the (r + 4) but not including the (s - 10),
#          what expression would you use in the _____ below?
#
#            for k in range((s-10) - (r+4)):
#
#     e. The following code snippet attempts to return the number
#          of integers from r to s, inclusive, whose cosines are positive.
#          It has at least 5 distinct errors (one per line).  What are they?
#
#              for k in range(r - s):       count = 0
#                  count = 0                for k in range(s+1-r):
#                  if math.cos(r) > 0:          if math.cos(k+r) > 0:
#                      count = 1                    count = count + 1
#                  return count             return count
#
#     f. The code in the "graphics accumulation" example below includes:
#            for _ in range(n):
#        What does the   _   (underscore) mean?
#
#     g. The code in the "graphics accumulation" example below includes:
#
#              x = starting_point.x
#              for _ in range(n):
#                  center = rg.Point(x, y)
#                  circle = rg.Circle(point, radius)
#                  circle.attach_to(window)
#                  x = x + diameter
#
#        If you want the row-of-circles that the above creates,
#        one of the following two attempts is a CORRECT attempt
#        (i.e., is equivalent in its functionality to the above)
#        and one is WRONG.  Which is the WRONG one?
#
#              x = starting_point.x
#              for k in range(n):
#                  center = rg.Point(x + (k * diameter), y)
#                  circle = rg.Circle(point, radius)
#                  circle.attach_to(window)

    # The example below shows one way to solve problems using
    #   HELPER variables (aka AUXILIARY variables)
    # In this approach:
    #  1. You determine all the variables that you need
    #       to construct/draw whatever the problem calls for.
    #       We call these HELPER variables.
    #  2. You initialize them BEFORE the loop, choosing values that
    #       make them just right for constructing and drawing the
    #       FIRST object to be drawn, in the FIRST time through the loop.
    #       For example,   x = starting_point.x   in the example below.
    #  3. You determine how many times the loop should run
    #       (generally, however many objects you want to draw)
    #       and write the FOR statement for the loop.
    #       For example,    for _ in range(n):  in the example below.
    #  4. Inside the loop you write the statements to construct and
    #       draw the FIRST object to be drawn, using your helper
    #       variables.  This is easy because you chose just the right
    #       values for those helper variables for this FIRST object.
    #  5. Test: Make sure the FIRST object appears.
    #       (It will be redrawn many times, that is OK).
    #  6. Add code at the BOTTOM of the loop that changes the helper
    #       variables appropriately for the NEXT time through the loop.
    #       For example,   x = x + diameter   in the example below.
    #  7. Test and fix as needed.
    #
    # Many students (and professionals) find this technique less
    # error-prone that using the loop variable to do all the work.
